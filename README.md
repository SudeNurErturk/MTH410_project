# MTH410_project

In this project, we are proceeding step by step and trying to train our Darpa dataset using random forest classifier, one of the machine learning algorithms. Meanwhile, we carry out some preliminary preparations (data cleaning, data visualization) in order to get the most efficient result from the dataset, which allows us to get the most efficient result.

In order to get efficient results from the project, we recommend running it with colab. By uploading the current dataset and file, you can process the ready-to-run project and see the results.
